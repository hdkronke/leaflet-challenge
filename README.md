# Leaflet Challenge
## Module 15

For this project, I used Leaflet mapping software to create a map of Alaska and detail recent earthquake activity in the area.

Loading the HTML in live server will lead to the map, simply click the "Earthquakes" box in the top right corner to generate the earthquake visualization.
The map legend is in the bottom right corner detailing the color key.

The events are identified by color and size and by clicking on one of them, you can view more specific information!
