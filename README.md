Module 15 Challenge

Here are my files for the Module 15 Challenge! Inside the Part 1 folder will be all the .JS and .HTML files to fulfill the assignment.

Loading the HTML in live server will lead to the map, simply click the "Earthquakes" box in the top right corner to generate the earthquake visualization.
The map legend is in the bottom right corner detailing the color key.

Cheers!
